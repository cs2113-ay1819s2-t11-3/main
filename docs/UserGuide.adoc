//end::report[]
// tag::report insight[]
=== Report Insight : `report insight/`
Further to report feature, users want to know more and understand their spending pattern so as to
improve on what they can consume or earn.
Hence, we developed this to aid in this problem.

Similar to report, this will show a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories and displays these information in a pie chart. +
There is 2 format for this command:

First, Format: `report insight/` where it will show the piechart in terms of the current entries available in the Budgeter.
Second, Format:`report insight/ d/START_DATE END_DATE`where it will show the piechart in terms of the start and end dates input into the the Budgeter.

****
* START_DATE/END_DATE follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of
*dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.
* START_DATE and END_DATE can be 'today'.
****

Once the command has been executed, a window will appear showing a pie chart containing data that is relevant in the range. +
At the same time, currently selected entries will be unselected to reduce confusion for the user. If there are many categories shown and
the box is not large enough, you can use the scroll bar at the side of each legend to view the other categories which are not in view.


[NOTE]
Due to label constraints, some labels may not be displaying correctly if they are overlapping with other labels. This happens when the pie slice
is too small. To improve readability, we have decided to hide some labels in such scenarios. Also, when the label is too long, since the pie charts
need to fit the labels, the pie chart may become small as a result. To prevent such situations, please keep your labels short. This will be improved in
later versions of the product to remove the labels completely and use a mouse over input instead.

* `report insight`
